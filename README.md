# decision-maker
A half-automated utility to make your decisions for you. Decision making is hard
and this algorithm takes the guess work out of comparing the advantages.

It works by the user weighting the comparative advantages and disadvantages and
then determing the more positive choice.

To get started simply run `python3 decide.py`.
